        "In growing AI and data science projects, it’s tempting to define large interfaces or base classes that try to do everything. But this leads to bloated, fragile code. That’s where the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) comes in, it encourages you to design smaller, more specific interfaces so classes only implement what they actually need.\n",

In Python ML codebases, this leads to cleaner abstractions, better testing, and more flexibility. Adopt these patterns early, and your ML projects will scale with confidence.
