In this article, you'll learn how to build a basic rule-based engine in Python that mimics real-world decision-making.\n",

        "Youâ€™ve just built a basic rule-based system, the backbone of many early AI applications. While this example is simple, the principles can be extended with complex logic, probabilistic reasoning, or even natural language processing for intelligent decision-making systems. Thanks for reading my article, let me know if you have any suggestions or similar implementations via the comment section. Until then, see you next time. Happy coding!\n",
