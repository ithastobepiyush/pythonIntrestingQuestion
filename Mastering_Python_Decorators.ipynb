        "#### Why Itâ€™s So Important\n",
        "Decorators in Python are one of the most powerful and useful tools, yet they are often underutilized. They allow you to \"wrap\" a function to extend its behavior without permanently modifying it. This becomes extremely handy when adding functionalities like logging, authentication, caching, or performance tracking. Mastering decorators boosts your ability to write clean, modular, and professional-grade code.\n",

By adding functionality without touching the core logic, decorators make your programs more modular, readable, and professional.
