        "    * Another subclass of `BaseModel`.\n",

        "The Liskov Substitution Principle is essential for building AI systems that are reliable, extensible, and bug-resistant. If your models inherit from a base class, make sure they behave exactly as expected. Otherwise, the elegance of inheritance becomes a trap. Adopt these patterns early, and your ML projects will scale with confidence. Thanks for reading my article, let me know if you have any suggestions or similar implementations via the comment section. Until then, see you next time. Happy coding!\n",
