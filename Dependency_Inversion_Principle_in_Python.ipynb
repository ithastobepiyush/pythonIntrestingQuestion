        "Machine Learning systems aren’t just models, they’re complex software systems with data pipelines, model orchestration, and deployment layers. Yet many ML engineers overlook design principles that make code production-ready. Today, let’s look at the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) and how it can transform the way you structure ML systems.\n",
