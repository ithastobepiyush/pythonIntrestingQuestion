        "AI doesn’t always have to be complicated. This simple NLP-based resume ranker shows how machine learning concepts can create real-world impact, especially in recruitment, HR tech, or freelance hiring systems. You can expand this further by adding PDF parsing, named entity recognition (NER), or using large language models for deeper understanding.
