        "Most machine learning tutorials focus on models and metrics but ignore code quality. In real-world applications, your ML code must be clean, modular, and maintainable.

        "2. `data_loader.py`\n",

        "    * Could be extended later to load from a database, CSV, or API.\n",
        "    * Follows the Single Responsibility Principle.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `model.py`\n",

        "    * Abstracted so you can easily switch between classifiers (e.g., SVM, XGBoost).\n",

        "4. `trainer.py`\n",

        "Machine learning isn't just about models; it's also about the engineering that powers them. Writing modular, maintainable code using software engineering principles ensures your models don’t just work today but continue to deliver value tomorrow. Adopt these patterns early, and your ML projects will scale with confidence. Thanks for reading my article, let me know if you have any suggestions or similar implementations via the comment section.
